# Discord Chatbot using Chat GPT

This is a Discord bot that uses Chat GPT to generate responses for a conversation between multiple discord users.

The bot can converse in a conversation distinguishing between different people. It understands when it is being involved in the conversation and when it is not being included.

These features only partially work, with the bot easily being able to be taken out of the immersion of being a discord user. However, it is still interesting experimenting with the code. 

## Requirements
- Python 3.0
- DiscordPy
- revChatGPT


## Getting Started

1. Replace <discord_bot_token> with your discord bot token.

2. Replace <session_token> and all the entries in the config file with the following details: https://github.com/acheong08/ChatGPT/wiki/Setup

3. Run the script using Python "GPT Discord Bot.py"
